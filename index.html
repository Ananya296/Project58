        <p> I love to do Art and craft like making something from paper, to paint , to make sketch of a person etc. My sister is very interested in Arts, so , One day i was just asking her to draw as it was my school Homework. So she said that she is busy i thought that i will only draw, when i was drawing i found it little interesting to draw and color and after 2 days i drew a sketch of my Best Friend i drew that first time but it was okay. From that day i found Arts little intresting and now i am a Intermediate. So i love to draw as Offline. Arts teched me a new thing;</p>
        <p id="Quote">"While drawing I discover what I really want to say."</p>
        <p> But if anyone askes me that what is your hobby online so i will choose coding only because i love to try new UI and the main BLOCKS!!</p>
